#' TCGA breast cancer data
#'
#' The TCGA breast cancer gene expression data used in our study.
#' The data are obtained from the TCGA database. They are collected from two platforms:
#' mRNA expression (Agilent G450 microarray) and mRNA expression (RNA sequencing).
#' The cancers are grouped into four subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched,
#' and Basal-like. The data only include expression measure of genes that overlap
#' with the breast cancer pathway collected from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
#' and Genomes database.
